# This is 'The Help Desk', welcome and thanks for checking in
# The point of this project is to assess someone's mental health status
# This application isn't able to be used for towns outside of CT
# It will ask a series of questions related to traditional mental health issues

# Afterwards it will send a possible diagnoses* **
# * Note this can't be 100% accurate
# ** Screen needed before diagnoses is published saying that this isn't accurate and can be wrong

# Then it will send locations for possible therapy/rehab/psychiatrists*, recommendations taken by possible diagnoses
# *Send local support groups based on the town
# If LGBTQ+ send trevor project
